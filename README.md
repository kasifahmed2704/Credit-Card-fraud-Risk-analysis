## 👋 Introduction
Credit card fraud is one of the **biggest challenges in banking and finance** — costing billions every year and constantly evolving with new techniques.  
This **Power BI project** analyzes credit card transactions to uncover fraud patterns, assess risk levels, and provide **interactive dashboards** that empower real-time decision-making.

I designed this dashboard to go beyond static charts — it tells a **story with the data**, helping stakeholders spot risky transactions before they become losses.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect and visualize **fraud trends** across regions, time, and transaction types.
- Assess **risk levels** and highlight critical fraud cases.
- Enable **interactive filtering** for deep dives into specific fraud categories or geographies.
- Provide **business-ready recommendations** to reduce fraud.
